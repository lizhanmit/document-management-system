Dr. Avaj has run her practice successfully for many years. Every year more and more patient documents get generated. Every time she needs to find a record of prior treatment, her assistants spend longer and longer searching their filing cabinets. Now she wants to manage as files on her computer. 

The Document Management System needs to be able to import these files and record some information about each file that can be indexed and searched. There are three types of documents that she cares about:

- Reports: A body of text detailing some consultation of operation on a patient.
- Letters: A text document that gets sent to an address. 
- Images: The dental practice often records x-rays or photos of teeth and gums. These have a size.

In addition, all documents need to record the path to the file that is being managed and what patient the document is about. Dr. Avaj needs to be able to search these documents, and query whether each of the attributes about a different type of document contains certain pieces of information; for example, to search for letters where the body contains "Joe Bloggs". 

Dr. Avaj might wish to add other types of documents in the future.
